# LLM Abstraction Layer

---

Welcome to this personal project of mine! This repository is dedicated to creating an abstraction layer designed specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal of this project is to simplify the integration and utilization of various LLM APIs, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, enabling developers to seamlessly switch between them with minimal effort.

## Project Overview

In the rapidly evolving field of AI and natural language processing, developers often face the challenge of adapting their code to accommodate different LLM APIs. This project addresses that challenge by providing a unified interface that abstracts the underlying complexities.

With this abstraction layer, developers can:

- Easily Switch Between LLMs: The framework allows you to switch between different LLM providers without needing to rewrite your code. Whether you want to test responses from OpenAI or Anthropic, you can do so effortlessly.
- Reuse Prompts Across APIs: By standardizing the way prompts are structured and sent, you can reuse your prompts across different LLMs. This promotes consistency and saves time during development.
- Focus on Output Quality: Instead of spending valuable time modifying your code for different APIs, you can concentrate on optimizing the prompts and improving the quality of outputs generated by the models.
